# Kipple

This is a management system for all the tools out there that support a healthy intellectual life.
Unlike most knowledge management tools, Kipple doesn't assume that you want to be some kind of
transhumanist of the mind. It just wants to help you think, remember, iterate, and move data
around between systems.

## Installation

The usual way:

```
npm install -g kipple
```

Note that on some platforms since Kipple relies on your local keychain to store passwords, you may
need to install `libsecret`. See [keytar](https://github.com/atom/node-keytar) for details.
